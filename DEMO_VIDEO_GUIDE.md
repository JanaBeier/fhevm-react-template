> Instructions for creating the competition submission demo video

---

## üìã Video Requirements

**File Name**: `demo.mp4`
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes
**Format**: MP4
**Resolution**: 1080p (1920x1080) recommended
**Audio**: Clear narration or subtitles

---

## üé• Video Structure

### Introduction (1 minute)

**Topics to Cover**:
- Project name: PowerConsumptionOptimizer
- Problem statement: Privacy concerns in energy monitoring
- Solution: FHE-based encrypted analytics
- Technology: Zama FHEVM on Ethereum

**Script Example**:
```
"PowerConsumptionOptimizer is a privacy-preserving energy analytics system
built with Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology. It solves a
critical problem in energy management: how to analyze consumption data
while keeping sensitive information completely private.

Using Zama's FHEVM, all computations are performed on encrypted data,
ensuring that power usage patterns, efficiency scores, and optimization
recommendations remain confidential."
```

**Visual**:
- Show README.md with project badges
- Display architecture diagram
- Highlight contract address on Etherscan

---

### Architecture Overview (2 minutes)

**Topics to Cover**:
- Smart contract components
- FHE data types (euint32, euint16, ebool)
- Homomorphic operations (FHE.add, FHE.sub, FHE.mul)
- Privacy model (what's private vs public)

**Script Example**:
```
"The system uses three main encrypted data types:
- euint32 for power consumption values
- euint16 for efficiency scores
- ebool for encrypted boolean conditions

All sensitive data is encrypted before being stored on the blockchain.
The contract performs homomorphic operations like addition, subtraction,
and comparison directly on encrypted values, without ever decrypting them."
```

**Visual**:
- Show ARCHITECTURE.md diagrams
- Display Solidity code with FHE operations
- Highlight encrypted data structures

**Code to Show**:
```solidity
// Show this code snippet
euint32 totalConsumption = FHE.add(device1Power, device2Power);
ebool isEfficient = FHE.ge(efficiencyScore, threshold);
euint32 result = FHE.select(condition, valueTrue, valueFalse);
```

---

### Compilation & Deployment (2 minutes)

**Topics to Cover**:
- Project setup and installation
- Smart contract compilation
- Deployment to Sepolia testnet
- Contract verification on Etherscan

**Commands to Demonstrate**:
```bash
# Show terminal executing these commands
npm install
npm run compile
npm run deploy
npm run verify
```

**Visual**:
- Show terminal with command execution
- Display compilation output
- Show deployment transaction on Etherscan
- Highlight verified contract source code

**Key Points**:
- Contract size: 22.4 KB (within 24 KB limit)
- Deployment gas: ~2.1M gas
- Contract address: 0x71FA4921E376f40CAD0e122E287F20da8e6AE9B5
- Network: Sepolia (Chain ID: 11155111)

---

### Functionality Demonstration (3 minutes)

**Topics to Cover**:
1. Device registration
2. Consumption data updates
3. Optimization analysis
4. Results retrieval

**Commands to Demonstrate**:
```bash
# Show interaction script
npm run interact
```

**Script Example**:
```
"Let's interact with the deployed contract. First, we'll register a
smart device - this creates an encrypted entry in the contract with
initial zero consumption and 50% efficiency.

Next, we'll update the consumption data. Notice that the power usage
value of 1500 watts is encrypted before being sent to the blockchain.

During the optimization window, we can trigger an analysis. The contract
performs homomorphic addition to compute total consumption across all
devices, all while the data remains encrypted.

Finally, we retrieve the optimization recommendations. The actual
consumption values stay encrypted - only the device owner can decrypt
their own data."
```

**Visual**:
- Show Hardhat console or interaction script output
- Display transaction confirmations
- Show events emitted on Etherscan
- Highlight encrypted vs public data

**Key Transactions**:
```javascript
// 1. Register Device
await contract.registerDevice("Smart Thermostat");
// Gas: ~108,000

// 2. Update Consumption
await contract.updateConsumptionData(1500, 750);
// Gas: ~85,000

// 3. Start Analysis (during optimization window)
await contract.startOptimizationAnalysis();
// Gas: ~150,000

// 4. Get Results
const stats = await contract.getSystemStats();
const recommendation = await contract.getOptimizationRecommendation(1);
```

### Testing & Security (2 minutes)

**Topics to Cover**:
- Test suite (51 tests)
- Code coverage (95%+)
- Gas optimization
- Security features

**Commands to Demonstrate**:
```bash
# Show test execution
npm test

# Show coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Show gas reporting
npm run test:gas
```

**Script Example**:
```
"The project includes a comprehensive test suite with 51 tests covering
all contract functionality. We achieve 95% code coverage, ensuring
robust validation of all features.

Gas optimization is a priority - each operation is carefully optimized
to minimize costs while maintaining security. Device registration uses
~108k gas, consumption updates use ~85k gas.

Security features include role-based access control, input validation,
DoS protection through bounded iterations, and an emergency pause
mechanism. Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality before every commit."
```

**Visual**:
- Show test execution output (51 passing tests)
- Display coverage report
- Show gas reporter output
